## Status: OnGoing

This project investigates the use of convolutional activation maps (CAMs) to enhance the interpretability and performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in detecting nightshade plant diseases. Utilizing a dataset of 33,000 images categorized into training, validation, and evaluation subsets across 15 disease classes, the project applies various CAM methods—such as EigenGradCAM, GradCAM++, ScoreCAM etc —to visualize and understand the model’s decision-making process. By analyzing perturbation-based metrics, such as Average Drop and Change in Confidence, the project evaluates how different CAM techniques impact model predictions and provides insights into their effectiveness in highlighting critical image features. The study demonstrates that EfficientNetV2-S outperforms other models in accuracy,f1 score, precision and recall, and identifies EigenGradCAM as particularly effective in pinpointing influential areas, thereby underscoring the potential of advanced deep learning models in enhancing the effectiveness of plant disease detection systems.
