## Status: OnGoing

"Poetica" examines the effectiveness of different transformer architectures in advancing poetry generation. This project aims to systematically compare various transformer models to assess their ability to produce high-quality poetic text. By leveraging cutting-edge transformer techniques, "Poetica" explores their impact on creativity, coherence, and adherence to poetic structures. The evaluation process includes a combination of quantitative metrics and qualitative human assessments to provide a comprehensive analysis of each modelâ€™s performance. This research contributes to the understanding of computational creativity and offers insights into optimizing transformer-based approaches for generating sophisticated and contextually rich poetry.
